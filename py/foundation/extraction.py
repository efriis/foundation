"""An ID for "something we wish to extract" in a document.

If you want to extract a thing from a document (a numeric value, an anchor, some
text, whatever), you need to represent it as an extraction field. An extraction
field is just a name for a thing-to-be-extracted. You can think of a field as
the analog of a variable in another modeling language. A Blueprint extraction
consists of assignments from a set of fields to entities in a document.
